# Create a GitHub Account

This guide explains the process for creating a GitHub account for a Broncobots team member.

## Prerequisites
- LSR7 or personal email address

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is where the Broncobots store all robot code, website sources, public documentation, etc.  It acts as a central location to store and share content that is helpful for both internal and external use.

It is expected that any team members that will contribute to these efforts either have their own personal account or uses the team's generic account [@frc1987](https://github.com/frc1987) while in the shop.

## Signing Up
1. Navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Click sign up.
3. Follow the prompts to create your account.

    - Note: Using a personal email will allow for retention of your GitHub account after graduation.  If you choose to use a LSR7 email, then you will need to change your account's associated email address prior to graduation.

## Next Steps
- [Join the Broncobots organization](join-the-organization.md)
